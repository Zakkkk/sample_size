# What sample size is needed for the Central Limit Theorem?

In school, I was taught that ideally you want a sample size of 30 for the CLT to apply, however, being skepticle, I decided to test this out with a simple program.

Simply run `main.py` and select the necessary options to simulate a collection of samples.

Interestingly, a sample size of 30 was not always required, and it will depend on how close the distribution is to the normal distribution, and whether the size is even or odd will also effect some distributions.
